# Basic-Calculator
Here's the link of the website: https://jacob09921.github.io/Basic-Calculator/

This project makes me dizzy actually but finally, I find the solution. The only problem that makes me hard at the project is the part about how you save the first number into your container. I use some arrays and variables to contain all patterns when clicking buttons. I created the project in 3 days. This calculator website is the second website that I created after the Tic Tac Toe

Feel free to check the source code.
