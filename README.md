# Basic-Calculator
Here's the link of the website: https://jacob09921.github.io/Basic-Calculator/

This project makes me dizzy actually but finally I find the solution. The only problem that makes me hard at the project is the part of how do you save the first number into your container. I created the project in 3 days. This  calculator website is the second webstie that I created after the Tic Tac Toe

Feel free to check the source code.
